# Temperature Converter 

This project was created using the React JS library and Tailwind CSS

The functionality consists of entering a value in Celsius or Fahrenheit (depending on the selected one) to perform the conversion to the opposite value. There are certain values where a fun fact about that value is displayed.

To create this project I use:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Vercel for deploy](https://vercel.com/)
